These are Flashcards to remember anything important that I've read.

I use this flashcards using neuracache app.

Following is the template example:

---

This is an example note with various cards to show what you can do.

```
You can import this file directly to the NeuraCache app to see what the effect will be
(No Ads, No Signup, Generous Free Tier, Offline)

NeuraCache can consume independent files or traverse a directory in search of cards. This works great with second brain tools like Obsidian.
Let's start with some basic micro cards:

Who was the first president of the USA? : George Washington ⚡️

You can also create decks with micro cards by adding various tags:

How many people are bitten by snakes each year? : 5.3M ⚡️ #nature #travel
How many people die each year from snake bites? : ~130k ⚡️ #nature #travel

Instead of ⚡️ you can also use 🧠 or flashcard tag.
For one line spaced repetition, use spaced tag:

"We are what we repeatedly do" #spaced

and similarly, you can group these cards into decks with tags

"Excellence is not an act but a habit" #spaced #quotes

Now let's create some more complex cards. 
Multi-line, Latex, and images are fine 👍

We end the card with a horizontal line which can defined with :
\-\-\-, \- \- \-, \*\*\*, \* \* \*

Let's try:
Radii of stable orbits in the Bohr model #flashcard #physics

$$a_0  = \frac{{ \hbar ^2}}{{m_e ke^2}}$$
(you can also inline) $\Delta E = h\nu$ and $c = \lambda \nu$

- - -

And the same thing with complex spaced repetition blocks: 

#spaced #quotes
"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."

You can also use local images. Just make sure that within the NeuraCache app, you either import a folder (where the .md and image is located) or, in case of a single file import -> tap and hold on the .md file and then tap the associated image (see here: https://youtu.be/Q_GD884BpW8?t=219)
